# Koka
A little project of mine for learning Rust, React, database management, and web scraping

## Requirements
- Chrome
- Functioning computer

## How to operate
- To be determined :3 (Too early in development, am just running src code in env, but want to make application standalone first)

## Future plans:
- Handle no wifi situations (version getting, scraping, setting up, etc)
- Security if I want to implement way to store credentials
- Implementing pre req checks (theoretically possible but loads of works)
- Improve splashscreen opening/closing timings

### Questions
If you want to contact me please don't I already have too much to think about T_T
