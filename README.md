# Plover
A little project of mine for learning Rust, React, database management, and web scraping

## Requirements
- Chrome
- Functioning computer

## How to operate
- To be determined :3 (Too early in development, am just running src code in env, but want to make application standalone first)

## Things to keep an eye on:
- Splashscreen flashing white on loading if the image has not fully loaded before window is shown

### Questions
If you want to contact me please don't I already have too much to think about T_T
